lua-midi-sequencing
===================

I got about 20 versions into this while I was learning how to do stuff, and I
realized "Hey, there is such a thing as git. Why not use it like an actual 
programmer?"

For my current musical project, I'd like to play around with some live coding with lua, 
throwing midi sequences at whatever softsynth or actual hardware synth which talks midi.

I initially chose Lua because I use Lua at work. Later I found that Lua is a powerful 
tool to use with many pieces of software I've encountered, including a really nice-looking 
DAW which runs on Linux. Really excited about that part.

Anyway, I love making music (more than I love making computers do things, as lucky as I
am to be able to do so for a living), so it's the perfect motivator to learn the hell out
of a programming language.

I want to code in a live situation where it's hard enough to have to put in some effort 
and show off my geekery, but there's enough infrastructure where I can do cool things without
writing 1,000 lines of code while everybody waits to hear sound.

Also, it has to have soul. No hipster noise nonsense, it's gotta have a groove, and 
it's gotta feel good to listen to. I'm playing live guitar and singing/playing trumpet 
and I've got an amazing drummer (seriously, amazing. Incredible jazz chops) so I'm 
pretty much writing basslines. But they gotta be sick basslines.

Feel free to steal the method. Steal the basslines, too, if you really feel the urge.
Don't steal my entire songs, I play out with these, and might try to make some kind of
name for myself. :)
